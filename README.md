### Grading 

* You MUST attend all the midterms and the final as there will be no make-up exams in this course.  Both midterms and the final are not cumulative. If you miss or likely to miss a midterm due to an emergency, please contact me as soon as possible.  You will need to provide supporting documentation/verification of your absence. I will re-weight your final exam accordingly if you have a valid excuse. Please note that family vacations or missing the school shuttle are not valid excuses.  If you miss the final exam due to an emergency, you will receive an incomplete for this course. Do not take this class if you know that you will not be able to attend the final exam.  


* You have 10 homework assignments. The submission system is automated and will not accept any submissions after the deadline (even 5 minutes).  You will miss the assignment and there will be no exceptions.  Homework assignments are long, and I do not expect you to complete all the questions. For each question, you have three attempts and if you receive **50%** of the overall score indicated in the homework assignment, you will receive full credit. Otherwise, you will receive zero. You can miss up to 3 homework assignments, I will take the average of the best 7 homework scores as your homework grade.  The questions are algorithmic, and they will be slightly different each time, so you are encouraged to work together on homework assignments.  

* All students should be familiar with the reading/presentation that are assigned on the day of the class. The assignments are academic papers and some of them involve sophisticated econometrics and mathematical modelling. What I expect from you is to understand the economic intuition/reasoning behind these studies. Do not be discouraged by the math, understand the research questions, approach, and the implications of the study. With another student,  you will be assigned to present one of the articles. The presentation should be between 20-25 minutes, followed by a discussion.

### Academic Integrity 

Learning is a privilege that demands responsibility. At Bentley, students and faculty are members of an academic community that supports integrity both inside and outside the classroom. The expectation at Bentley is that students will take advantage of the opportunity for intellectual development and, in doing so, will conduct themselves in a manner consistent with the standards of academic integrity. When these standards are violated or compromised, individuals and the entire Bentley community suffer. Students who engage in acts of academic dishonesty not only face university censure but also may harm their future educational and employment opportunities. In other words, don’t bring unauthorized materials into exams, don’t plagiarize someone else’s work, and make sure that your collaborations are conducted in accordance with university and course policy.  

All students have access to Bentley’s academic integrity policy on Blackboard (via the Academic Integrity course page) and the Undergraduate Student Handbook/Graduate Catalog. The best way to avoid a problem is to consult with your instructor before taking any action that might constitute a violation. 


### Diversity Inclusion and Support 

**Statement of Diversity and Inclusion**

My goal in this class is to create a teaching environment that is inclusive for all of the members of our community independent of their race, gender, age, disability status, and political or religious views. Our differences strengthen our ability for perspective taking, being critical about our default believes,and enhance learning. 

I will try to reach this goal within my best capacity by respect and professionalism in our class-related engagements and I anticipate students to do the same. These standards of appropriate conduct are well summarized by [Bentley's Core Values](https://www.bentley.edu/about/mission-and-values) in our institution's mission statement. 


If you feel that I or anyone in this class has acted outside these values, please come to me so that we may discuss your experience. If you do not feel comfortable coming to me with your concerns, I encourage you to speak with someone in the Office of Academic Advising: 781.891.2803, academic_services@bentley.edu, Jennison 336.      

My class roster has your preferred name, but I will happily address you by an alternate name and/or pronoun. Just let me know your preference early in the semester. 

**Bias Incident Response**

The Bias Incident Response Team (BIRT) provides students affected by bias or bias-related incidents with access to appropriate resources. Where appropriate, BIRT assists the University in its response to situations that may impact the overall campus climate related to diversity and inclusion. Working closely with appropriate students, faculty, committees, organizations, and staff, BIRT plays an educational role in fostering an inclusive campus community and supporting targeted individuals when bias or bias-related incidents occur. More information about BIRT and how to file a bias incident report can be found at: https://www.bentley.edu/offices/student-affairs/birt

**Disability Services** 

Bentley University abides by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 which stipulate no student shall be denied the benefits of an education solely by reason of a disability. If you have a hidden or visible disability which may require classroom accommodations, please call (if you are a residential student or on online student) Disability Services within the first 4 weeks of the semester to schedule an appointment. Disability Services is located in the Office of Academic Services (JEN 336, 781.891.2004). Disability Services is responsible for managing accommodations and services for all students with disabilities. 

The Undergraduate Academic Services (UAS) Peer Tutoring program offers online one-on-one and small group tutoring services for students who have worked with their instructors and made use of the Learning Centers, but still require additional academic support. The program goal is to help those students in true need who are willing to take responsibility for their own learning. Please reach out to me if you need more information. 

**The Howard A. Winer ‘58 Lab for Economics, Accounting and Finance (LEAF)** 

The LEAF will open on Sunday September 19, 2021 for the semester.  The LEAF’s hours of operation will be Sundays from 5:00--9:00 and Mondays through Thursdays from 12:30--9:00. For the fall 2021 semester, the LEAF tutoring will be done both in person and remotely using Zoom.  Please use the instructions below to access additional LEAF information.

### Online Attendance 

All students must attend the in-person classes. If you join the class online due to an exception, please follow the guidelines indicated below:   

**Zoom Protocol and Online Attendance** 

Students **must** join classes through their Bentley Zoom account. Go to [bentley.zoom.us](https://bentley.zoom.us) and enter the course meeting number to join the session. The zoom link is included on Black Board course page. 

I expect you to attend class with a functioning microphone and camera. Cameras should be on to effectively engage in class and participate throughout the course. If you have an impediment to keeping your camera on, please let me know so that we can work to arrive at a mutually agreeable solution.

You are expected to be able to access all electronic course materials. It is your responsibility to review the course syllabus as soon as possible to determine what resources or materials I expect you to use in the course. If you are a student in an international location that may limit access to certain internet resources, please let me know immediately so you can find a solution. 

Students are expected to attend classes synchronously despite potential time zone hurdles. Solely watching recorded classes is not deemed to be acceptable course participation or completion. Course recordings are for the benefit of students who miss an occasional class or would like to watch the recording for further edification of materials. Class recordings that are posted to BB are for the sole purpose of this course. Disseminating any portion of this video in any manner is strictly prohibited.
